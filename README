Nebula - Android Group Communication Application

Nebula will be an application that offers group communication among its users. 
It will run over SIP to make its integration into IMS possible. The main scope 
of Nebula is to provide support for different ways of communications within a 
user defined group including video call, conference, instant messaging etc. 
Group management can be based on various criteria e.g. context awareness, 
geographical location or availability. Our team, along with the SALCAS team, 
will deliver two distributions of Nebula, one for Android and another for Linux 
respectively. The aim is to make the group communication interoperable between 
above mentioned distributions. In the Android version, Nebula users will be able 
to manage the address book by adding the contacts manually or importing them from 
phone address book along with exporting/importing contacts to/from other users.
